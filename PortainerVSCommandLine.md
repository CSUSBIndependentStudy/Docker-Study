## Overview

This lesson will compare the features of Portainer and demonstrate the simplicity it can create in your day-to-day workflow versus
using the command line for every little aspect of managing Docker. I will show the Docker command, then the equivalent feature in Portainer.

## List Containers

Use the following command to list all running containers in Docker:

```
docker ps
```
Side note: If you're wanting to list all containers (regarless of whether they're running or stopped) use:

```
docker ps -a
```
